This is an **Intermediate** level challenge by [FrontEndMentor - The Bookmark Landing Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bookmark-landing-page-5d0b588a9edda32581d29158)

Here's a **[LIVE PREVIEW](https://ubiquitous-pudding-dabbd5.netlify.app/)**

My thoughts about the challenge:

- Getting the layout to be **resposive** was quite tricky. 
- A bunch of SVG's were locked behind a paywall. I had to make some of them in Canva myself in order to replicate the design.
